Ingress:
In the in gresss resource there will be only one service exposed which will be portfolio_frontend and the other
services like databases and python(django) backend should be kept inside k8s cluster without 
exposing it to the outside world because of security issues and we do not want it to the outside world 
but the question is that,
What if we need some apis from this backend in our other projects then how should only these apis 
or this backend should be exposed to the outside world ?

Deployments:
react_frontend --
postgresql --
nginx with django (gunicorn or wsg) --
celery -- ? Leave it as of now
redis ? -- ? Leave it as of now


1--FRONTEND--) The best approach is to decouple services whoch k8s is all bout (microservices) it means that react with nginx:lightweight 
servoice with each.
2--BACKEND--) The second service should for wsgi(gunicorn or wsgi) with django and nginx separate ly for separation of concerns in a 
single k8s service.
3--POSTGRESQL) The third service should be about postgresql database wich should also be in a separate service
why because if react srvice or django service failed then still database service will worrk correctly.



Deployment ??
1--- Postgresql in k8s and test it from local connection of your django app ?
2--- Gunicorn and django in nginx web server ?
3--- React app with nginx:light(alpine)
